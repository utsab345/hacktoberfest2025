# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Simple Todo List (React + TypeScript)

This is a simple **Todo List** application built with **React** and **TypeScript**.  
The project focuses on core **functionality** and **logic**, using only React’s built-in `useState` hook for state management.  
It’s intentionally minimal to keep the codebase clean and easy to understand.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project serves as a foundational example that can be **extended** in the future by integrating third-party state management libraries such as **Zustand**, **Redux**, or **Jotai**.

## 🎨 UI & Styling

To simplify UI development and stay focused on functionality, the project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.  
Tailwind provides a utility-first approach, making it easy to iterate on UI quickly without complex styling setups.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Yarn** (as the package manager)

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Integrate third-party state management (Zustand, Redux, or Jotai)
- Add persistent storage (localStorage or IndexedDB)
- Include task filters (All / Active / Completed)
- Improve accessibility and animations

## 💡 How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
yarn dev
```
